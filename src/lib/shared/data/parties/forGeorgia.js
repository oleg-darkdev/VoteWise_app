		`For Georgia was formed by former Georgian Dream's Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, who resigned and left the Georgian Dream in February 2021. The party has been critical of both the Georgian Dream government and the largest opposition party United National Movement.`,
		`It accused GD of intentionally derailing Georgia's Euro-Integration process to protect Bidzina Ivanishvili's personal interests in legal case against Western bank, while slamming the UNM for contributing to the polarization in the country. GD denounced For Georgia as "traitors" while UNM accused them of being "Ivanishvili's back-up plan" in case GD becomes too unpopular.`,

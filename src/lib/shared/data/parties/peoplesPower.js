		`People's Power was formed by a group of MPs who split from the Georgian Dream to "speak more openly" about European Union's refusal to grant Georgia the candidate status in June 2022. The MPs accused the EU and USA of trying to pressure the Georgian government and overthrow it. Its ideology revolves around "protecting Georgia's sovereignity" from foreign forces and limiting foreign influence in the country. `,
		`To that end, the group proposed to pass a foreign agent law similar to American FARA, although the proposal was met by protests and was eventually rejected. Although People's Power is the third largest grouping in the Parliament, it does not have official status of the political party and closely cooperates with the Georgian Dream, some describing them as partners in coalition. `,

		`The party was founded in 2001 by Mikheil Saakashvili as a vehicle for opposition politicians to unite and challenge then-president Eduard Shevardnadze. The 2003 Rose Revolution against Shevardnadze's rule brought party to the power until its defeat in the 2012 election. Since then, the UNM is the main opposition party. `,
		`The party supports economic liberalism, civic nationalism, "tough-on-crime" policy, Euro-Atlantic integration, and strongly opposes any rapprochement towards Russia. Mikheil Saakashvili plays central figure in the party to this day and Saakashvili's supporters are the largest bloc that comprise the UNM's voter base.`,
